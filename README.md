Exercise 4: Functions and libraries

**TODO:**

1. Continue with writing functions to temp_converter.py -file:
  - Celsius to Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit to Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. Continue adding stuff for calculator.py
  - Student should add third parameter thus having (temp, convert_from, convert_to)
  - Calculator should ask which is the input temperature type ('K' | 'C' | 'F') and to which temperature the value will be converted ('K' | 'C' | 'F')
3. Calculator should round float numbers to decimal with 1 decimal (e.g. 4.1) ==> Practice using numpy round function
4. If calculator does not recognize the input or output types (i.e. something else than 'K' | 'C' | 'F' is passed), it should tell about it, and return nothing (None). 
5. Calculator should check if the input temperature is numerical.
