Exercise 4: Functions and libraries

**TODO:**

_Temparature converter exercise:_

1. Add functions to temp_converter.py -file:
  - Celsius to Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit to Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit to Celsius
2. Continue adding stuff for calculator.py
  - Student should add third parameter thus having (temp, convert_from, convert_to)
  - Calculator should ask which is the input temperature type ('K' | 'C' | 'F') and to which temperature the value will be converted ('K' | 'C' | 'F')
